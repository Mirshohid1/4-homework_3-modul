### For the Mentor
This project was created purely for practice. At this stage, I did not use certain tools to improve code readability and organization, focusing instead on the logic of the tasks.

The code was written manually: I did not use AI to generate the logic but only to search for the necessary information.

Additionally, I have recently learned about docstrings and wrote the docstrings for this project myself. Moving forward, I plan to consistently use them to improve code clarity and documentation.

In the future, I aim to make the code more readable, well-organized, and optimized.
